First of all, you must educate yourself and use cryptocurrency software at your own discretion.

It's extremely important that you try any new process with insignificant amounts until you know 
the risks involved and feel confortable with it.

As with any cryptocurrency, there is a high risk that you can loose all the money involved in the  process. You can, for example, loose your private key or have it stolen by fraudlent software or
scammers.

Simply do a great favor for yourself by getting to know what you are doing **before**
using any of these tutorials.
