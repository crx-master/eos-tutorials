It's extremely important that you try any new process putting insignificant amounts of money until you know the risks involved and feel comfortable with it.

As with any process involving cryptocurrency, there is a high risk that you can loose all the money involved. You can, for example, loose your private key and get tokens locked forever, or have your private key stolen by fraudlent software or a
scammer and get your account cleaned.

Simply do a great favor for yourself by getting to know what you are doing **before**
