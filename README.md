## First, the disclaimer

Before getting into action, please read this disclaimer of the tutorial authors.

You **must** educate yourself enough to be able to use cryptocurrency software securely and always at your own discretion.

It's extremely important that you try any new process putting insignificant amounts of money until you know the risks involved and feel comfortable with it.

As with any process involving cryptocurrency, there is a high risk that you loose all the money involved. You can, for example, loose your private key and lock your tokens forever, or you can have your account cleaned by fraudlent software or by a
scammer that manage to steal your private key.

Do a great favor for yourself by examining and getting to know what you will do at **every** step of these tutorials.
