# Install and configure an EOS wallet software

For a regular user to interact with EOS blockchain, it's interesting to use a wallet software. Doing
so, you can sign a transaction and publish it to the blockchain without exposing your private key.

On the other hand, you will have to trust your pk to the chosen wallet software and it's process of storing it. That's why hardware wallets do a lot of success with several other cyptocurrencies and at this point we all hope some project get a good hardware wallet compatible with EOS as soon as possible.

So, for this purpose, always use an auditable open source code software, and always check the origin of your download. 

For this tutorials, we chose to use [Scatter](https://github.com/EOSEssentials/Scatter), a browser extension that works with Google Chrome or Firefox.

3. Create a very strong password to protect Scatter local data storage;
4. Write down securely the backup words that will give you access to this Scatter install in
